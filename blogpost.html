        <p>This is Bowser</p>

        <p>Bowser is the 14th fighter in Super Smash Bros Ultimate. He is a heavy character, meaning he does more damage than most fighters! He's a great fighter to start with.</p>

        <p>Looks a lot like Kirby under the mask. Actually a pretty good fighter in my opinion but quite hard to master.</p>

        <p>All fighters are at least somewhat decent as long as you use them properly. Go on and have fun!</p>
